# foxtrot
all project files for project-foxtrot

[9/9/23] woo! finally actually getting started on this! can't wait to see where this project takes me
[11/9/23] wow its bit a while. sadly this project folded fairly early in development, and after a long break i've decided to switch back to the original foxtrot branch. the previously named "foxtrotLegacy" is now the main foxtrot project and this is now known as "foxtrot-depreciated"
